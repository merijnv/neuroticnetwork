This project is an attempt to create a neural network from the ground up, using
plain java and plain java objects.

So, first off, performance is not a concern here, this project is intended to
build a neural network from the ground up to get a better understanding how
they actually work. That is, how the neurons depend on their inputs, how
back-propagation works and maybe a few other things I can learn from this.

My intention is to create this step by step, and have each step sit in separate
branch, so everyone can see the steps I made to create this.

See git branch for the list of steps, checkout each branch in order, to see how
the first step goes to the next etc.
